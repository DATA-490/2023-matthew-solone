# Type of project

    Senior capstone project for the certificate in Data Science. 

# Purpose (including intended audience)

    The Center for Regenerative Agriculture and Resilient Systems (CRARS) mission is to investigate, develop, demonstrate, and educate about comprehensive, regenerative practices that both restore and enhance the resiliency of living systems and communities. CRARS takes on clients from around the state to provide analyses of soil and food samples, allowing clients to improve upon their regenerative practices.
    
    This project aims to streamline the soil sample intake process for the Center of Regenerative Agriculture and Resilient Systems (CRARS) using barcode scanners. The CRARS team currently uses Slack communication in addition to a collaborative Excel document to update other team members on their progress in the lab, which can lead to lost or overlooked updates on sample progress through the intake process. By implementing a tracking system using barcodes, the team will be able to clearly document each stage of sample intake and testing, including receiving, sieving & grinding, vialing, and the pre-transport check.
